To add a resource to the framework

ADD A CONTROLLER FOR THE RESOURCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three steps to add a controller:
1. Update the resources.xqy with the controller name and path information.
2. Add the implementation of the controller module to /app/controller directory.
        The file name of the controller should be the key specified in
        resources.xqy with "-controller" appended to the file name.
        For example, controller-key = "xyz", then
        controller file would be /app/controller/xyz-controller.xqy.
3. Determine which HTTP methods the controller will support.
        Below is a mapping of HTTP methods to controller functions:
        HTTP method => controller function
        ----------------------------------
        GET => controller:show
        PUT => controller:update
        DELETE => controller:destroy
        POST => controller:create

ADDING A RESOURCE REPERSENTATION (view)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two steps to add a view:
1. Determine the the repersentations that the resource will support.
    (JSON is free)
2. For each resource repersentation (excluding JSON) add a implementation
    of the repersentation app/view directory.
        The file name of the view should follow naming convention:
            {controller-key}.{repersentation}.xqy.
        To access the model generated by the controller in the view define:
        declare variable $view:model as element() external;
        
        To access the parameters passed to the controller in the view define:
        declare variable $controller:params as map:map external;
            
Also see resources.xqy and action-controller.xqy for more detailed information.
